uportal-irc-summarized
======================

Lovingly curated summaries of uPortal project IRC logs.

What is this
------------

Structured, hand-curated summaries of the uPortal IRC channel, which is currently `#jasig-uportal` on Freenode.


Why?
----

### Improving the signal-to-noise ratio

Raw IRC logs can have a poor signal-to-noise ratio.  Depending on who happened to be available at the moment of a conversation they may have more or less complete thoughts, may have asynchronous followup, dangling open loops, unanswered questions.  

Curated summaries can add signal and filter noise, drawing the connections and adding the links that make it easier to understand what's to be gained from these conversations.

I'm just more of a long-form writing kind of a person.

### Improving followup

Conversations in IRC may have opportunities to followup -- opportunities for an email thread, opportunities to improve product documentation, opportunities to backlog an issue.  

It's hard to know whether IRC conversations have been followed up upon without digesting them.

So, digesting.

### Batching the distractions of IRC

By undertaking this project I know I will read and think about every conversation that happens in uPortal IRC, and that reduces the pressure to participate in conversations in real time, which is great, because I can curate logs during bouts of insomnia and on the bus, but the only time I can develop software "in flow" is when I'm in flow, and paying attention to IRC detracts from flow.

This doesn't mean I seek to never be in IRC -- sometimes real time conversations via text are helpful -- but it does mean this project blunts the downsides of when I choose not to pay attention to IRC and pay attention instead to more fruitful things.

How can I help?
---------------

* Pull requests welcome.
* Sooner or later I'm going to get around to writing a script to automate pulling down echelog logs so I can consume them locally instead of in a browser.  If you wanted to write that script for me, that would be lovely.  (How cool would it be if the echelog logs were a Git repo? :) ).


Wouldn't you rather do this in a wiki?
--------------------------------------

Heck no.  Markdown in GitHub is all the wiki this needs.  Click to edit, send me a pull request.  Don't like how these summaries are going?  Fork and write your own and then I can stop wasting my time doing this. :)

You don't need to do this
-------------------------

Maybe not.  Let's see how it goes.
